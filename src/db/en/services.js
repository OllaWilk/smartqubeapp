      "Along with the integration concept, field services are the part of our extended customer care portfolio. Integration type projects are often sought after by EPC contractors on large industrial sites, who do not have adequate human resources/knowledge to properly execute complex and branch specific projects. Due to this, often a Plug& Play concept is implemented - the system, built in a workshop, needs to be tested to an extent that would allow it to be simply plugged in on site, without the need for engaging end user's or contractor's staff.",
